# Fabrice Bellard ([Bellard.org](https://bellard.org/))




## Reasons why Bellard is my favourite developer:
1. He made [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) (I'll touch on later)
2. He made [TCC](https://www.bellard.org/tcc/) (I'll touch on later)

## Reasons his projects are cool:
### [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)
Personally, I've got ffmpeg installed on *all* of my machines, even my [phome](https://github.com/caydey/ffshare)!
I really like ffmpeg, as like many others, because of its extreme versitility; it just supports so many formats!
ffmpeg is arguably my favourite software project;
### [TCC](https://www.bellard.org/tcc/)
TCC is just a fun project
### [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/)
Need I say more?
### [jslinux](https://bellard.org/jslinux/)
This is a less heard of, but nonetheless *very* impressive project.
It's an emulator, similar to QEMU, but, as the name would suggest, written in f-ing JAVASCRIPT!

In conclusion, cool guy.
