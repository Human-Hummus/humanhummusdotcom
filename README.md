# The HumanHummus.com website source code!
![Website icon](favicon.jpg)


My personal website, with information, games, demos, and more!

You can view [the source code for the website on GitHub](https://github.com/Human-Hummus/humanhummusdotcom/tree/main) (if you aren't already!).
On these pages, you can view the source code for the games and demos as well.

### Misc. Tech Info:
- copy etc.nginx to /etc/nginx on the host server
- add autoupdate.sh to run on boot, to keep the server up to date.
- **if building the server from scratch, the /etc/nginx files *will* be invalid; be sure to update them**
- this folder should be at /humanhummusdotcom
- if you want to host this website locally, just cd into the directory and run `python3 -m http.server`
