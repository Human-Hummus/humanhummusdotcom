# The HumanHummus.com website source code!

My personal website, with information, games, demos, and more!

### Misc. info.
    - copy etc.nginx to /etc/nginx on the host server
    - add autoupdate.sh to run on boot, to keep the server up to date.
    - __if building the server from scratch, the /etc/nginx files *will* be invalid; be sure to update them__
